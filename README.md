## ModMyFactory

![alt tag](http://i.imgur.com/VFnFzyM.png)

ModMyFactory is a Factorio mod manager with lots of extra features.
These include:

#### Access to mods.factorio.com
Download mods from the official mod portal.
Update your mods manually or automatically.

#### Modpacks
Create custom modpacks that can contain as many mods _and_ modpacks as you wish.  
Modpacks are resolved recursively, so feel free to go as deep as you like.

#### Factorio version management
Add and manage all factorio versions you like to play on at the same time.  
New versions can be added from existing local installations or downloaded directly from the factorio.com website (requires login).

#### Mod version detection
ModMyFactory will detect to which version of Factorio a mod belongs, place it in the correct mod directory and group them by version in the overview.

#### Link creation
Create shortcuts that automatically enable specific modpacks and start specific versions of the game.  
Playing on multiple different configurations is now as easy as playing on just one.

#### Folder selection
Select where Factorio and mods are stored on your local hard drives - without editing any configuration files.  
Available locations are AppData, the ModMyFactory installation directory and completely custom locations.

#### Localization
ModMyFactory has full support of localization.  
Currently available languages are: English, German, Russian, Portuguese, Chinese, Korean (hopefully more to come).

### System requirements
ModMyFactory has the following system requirements:

- .Net Framework 4.5.2

There will most likely never be Linux support from my side as Mono does not support WPF. Sorry.
